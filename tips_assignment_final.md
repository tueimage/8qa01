# Final assignment

For the final assignment you have to hand in your report and your code, in a ZIP file on Canvas. Some tips:

* Your report can be in English or Dutch, and must be at most 10 pages A4 (excluding front page, appendices, reference list etc.). Read more about the report here: https://github.com/tueimage/8qa01/blob/master/tips_report.md

*	Please include all code needed to perform your experiments in the ZIP file, but do NOT include the images. Do not rename files you are provided, except changing the group number. The code has to run if it is unzipped on a different computer, after changing the directory where the images are located.

During the second COC, some practical tips and guidelines will be given for what is expected from you in the report. The grading system will also be made available on Canvas.


# Assessment

Your grade is composed of 3 parts:
* 50% group work, given by your group and mentor
* 33.33% report and code
* 16.67% presentation

The main things to pay attention to are:

*	Creativity/quality of proposed method (report/code)
*	Clarity of explanation, readability, structure of report
*	Creativity and clarity of the presentation


## Assessment - report & code

More specifically, your report and code are evaluated on the following criteria:

* Creativity and quality of the features/score - are the default methods used, or other features/scores also introduced? Are the steps for these methods feasible given the problem?
* Creativity and quality of the experiment/results - are the default methods used, or other types of evaluation also introduced? Are the steps of this evaluation correct given the problem?
* Discussion - are the advantages/disadvantages of the method discussed in detail? Are other aspects of such technology discussed?
* Structure - is the required format followed? Are the different sections of the report part of a whole? Is information introduced in a logical order?
* Readability - is the report written and formatted in a way that is easy to read?
* Code - does the code run, and how clear/readable is it to other users? (See https://github.com/tueimage/8qa01/blob/master/tips_code.md)
